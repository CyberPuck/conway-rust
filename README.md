# Simple Conway's Game of Life
This is a very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
## Summary
It must read in a plaintext,  comma delimited file that specifies the inital conditions of the simulation.
Once the file is parsed, the engine starts up and renders the results in a Window generated by nannou.
### File Format
File extenion is not important, as long as the application can reach and read the file it will be parsed.
#### Requirements
- File must be plaintext
- Data fields must be comma delimited (like CSV)
- The first line must be the header
##### Header
- Header must have at least four fields
- Each field must be a positive integer, currently parsed as `usize`
- The field order is:
1. row size
2. column size
3. update rate
4. number of steps for the simulation to take
- If number of steps is 0 the simulation will run until the application terminates
##### Body
- Every line after the header is a body entry
- Each line in the file must be less than or equal to column_size
- Lines smaller than column_size will have the empty entries treated as the initial value built into the simulation grid
- If the number of lines exceeds the row_size the application will throw an error and stop operations
##### Comments
- Any line starting with '#' will be skipped and not parsed by the engine
